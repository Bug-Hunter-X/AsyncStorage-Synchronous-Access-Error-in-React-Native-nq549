This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving the use of AsyncStorage.  The example showcases an attempt to access AsyncStorage data synchronously, leading to unexpected undefined values. The solution provided uses async/await to correctly handle the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage operations.  Refer to bug.js for the erroneous code and bugSolution.js for the corrected implementation.
