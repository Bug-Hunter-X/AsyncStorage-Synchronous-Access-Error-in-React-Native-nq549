This React Native code snippet demonstrates a common error related to the usage of AsyncStorage.  The problem arises when attempting to access AsyncStorage data synchronously. AsyncStorage operations are inherently asynchronous, meaning they don't complete immediately. Attempting to access the result directly (without `await` or `.then()`) will likely result in undefined or null values.
